Sitemap
=======

The ``SonataSeoBundle`` provides a support for static sitemap generation.

The configuration need to set:
 - a doctrine connection
 - a route
 - default parameters used by the route
 - the query which must contains all informations required by a sitemap: lastmod, changefreq and prioriy

The url is generated by using ``route`` and ``parameters`` settings.

For performance reason and memory usage there is no model hydrated while generating the sitemap. So if the sitemap required
specific rules, they must be express in the ``WHERE`` condition. The query must select fields used in the route.

The following code is an extract of the query required to generate a valid sitemap for the ``SonataNewsBundle``

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT
        CONCAT_WS('/', YEAR(created_at), MONTH(created_at), DAY(created_at), slug) as permalink ,
        updated_at as lastmod,
        'weekly' as changefreq,
        '0.5' as prioriy
    FROM news__post
    WHERE
            enabled = 1
        AND (publication_date_start IS NULL OR publication_date_start <= NOW())


Please note: the ``changefreq`` and the ``prioriy`` fields are optionals.

Configuration
-------------

                - { group: "news",  connection: doctrine.dbal.default_connection, route: sonata_news_view, parameters: {permalink: null}, query: "SELECT CONCAT_WS('/', YEAR(created_at), MONTH(created_at), DAY(created_at), slug) as permalink , updated_at as lastmod, 'weekly' as changefreq, '0.5' as prioriy FROM news__post WHERE enabled = 1 AND (publication_date_start IS NULL OR publication_date_start <= NOW())" }
