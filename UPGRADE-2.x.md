UPGRADE 2.x
===========

### Deprecated omitting menu registry argument to breadcrumbs menu block service

`Sonata\SeoBundle\Block\Breadcrumb\BaseBreadcrumbMenuBlockService` now has an
optional argument called `$menuRegistry`. You should pass a
`Sonata\BlockBundle\Menu\MenuRegistryInterface` instance into it.

UPGRADE FROM 2.2 to 2.3
=======================

`sonata-project/block-bundle` is not required anymore. If you want to use seo friendly blocks,
you should require it on your own by calling `composer require sonata-project/block-bundle`.

UPGRADE FROM 2.0 to 2.1
=======================

### Deprecated methods in `Sonata\SeoBundle\Twig\Extension`

| deprecated method | recommended method |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `renderTitle()` | `getTitle()` |
| `renderMetadatas()` | `getMetadatas()` |
| `renderHtmlAttributes()` | `getHtmlAttributes()` |
| `renderHeadAttributes()` | `getHeadAttributes()` |
| `renderLinkCanonical()` | `getLinkCanonical()` |
| `renderLangAlternates()` | `getLangAlternates()` |

### Tests

All files under the ``Tests`` directory are now correctly handled as internal test classes. 
You can't extend them anymore, because they are only loaded when running internal tests. 
More information can be found in the [composer docs](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload-dev).
